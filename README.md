Short description of project. 
This AI model will be my attempt at creating a better version of DuoLingo. I am a language learner myself and speak Russian at a B1 level and I just started really getting into Spanish. The application would be helpful to learn new relevant phrases based on my current skill set. I want it to be able to learn a person's current level and elevate them to another level based on the standard language levels (A1,A2,B1,B2,C1,C2). 


Project Notes:




- Be sure to create your report in the **intro-gen-ai** organization. 
- The name of the repo should be the name of the project, or a shortened version of the name.
- Each section should be completed by the deadline indicated. You submit by making a commit of this README.md file. Except for minor edits, please do no change the Proposal, Goals, or Metrics sections after the submission deadline.
- General guidance on formatting writing in markdown files (like this README.md file) is at https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax.

### Description of Problem/Opportunity


### Proposed Solution/Approach


### Project Outline and Timeline
So the goal of this artificial intelligence model to not teach a language but to be a supplement to speaking lessons that you are already having with a tutor. There is no replace one on one speaking. This model can be used as homework and a way to gain new vocabulary words to bring to your lesson. It can also be a great way to spark questions that you can go over in class or private lessons. 


1st Stage: 
The first stage of this AI model will be a language test that will determine the level of speaker you are. It will be no more than 20 questions and the result will be either A1,A2,B1,B2,C1 or C2. This is a standard language proficiency scale that is used around the world. In this specific AI model we will be focusing on Spanish since that is 1. A language with a large input to AI model training and 2. A language that I am currently learning right now. 


The questions will not be set in stone but rather change around depending on how you answer them. If you get the first question correct then the next question will get a little harder until the AI has a good idea of what level of proficiency you have. After your language level is determined it will be easier to provide the user with prompt questions and suggestions for words to learn. 


2nd Stage: The user is prompted with why they want to learn the language (Spanish in this case). If they want to learn for travel my model will gear the teaching towards typical travel words and phrases. If the user wants to get better at Spanish because his/her significant other is Spanish and they want to meet the family my model will change and be able to curtail the learning to the specific needs of the learner. An example of a question that would be for a would be traveler is “what time does our flight leave” and a question for someone who has dinner with a Hispanic family would be “how long have you been living in the United States”. There are many reasons why someone would want to learn a language but their reasoning can be more broad too in which the AI model will respond accordingly. 


3rd Stage: The third stage is the actual learning part. If you are a beginner you should be learning the basics of conversation in class. The AI model will be for speakers with a least a small vocabulary. It will ask you a question in Spanish and then you respond in Spanish. It will correct your mistake but also provide you with a different way to say the same phrase. Following your answer it will also provide you with two new words that could have been integrated into your answer. At the end of your session it will provide you with a final list of new vocabulary words. As it sees your progress getting better over time the questions will get a bit more difficult and broader. The user will also be able to prompt the AI with certain topics they want to cover. If they are a general learner but have struggled at ordering food from restaurants they can focus in on restaurant central topics and questions.

## Goals of project 
**Due March 21, 11:59pm**

Describe 1-5 goals of the project. 
**Goal 1:** Create a Spanish Ai model that is able to accurately assess a person’s current ability in the language in 20 or less questions. I want to test this with current Vanderbilt Spanish speakers ranging from beginners to native speakers
**Goal 2**: Create an AI model that is able to accurately match the ability score and specific learner goals to produce a question that represents each metric well. 
**Goal 3**: Have users be able to interact with the model easily and have it provide them useful feedback that is accurate 

## Project Metrics 
**Due March 21, 11:59pm**

Compose 2-5 metrics to determine the success of the project. These should be measureable, and should translate to a letter grade for each. 
**Metric #1**: 
Is the original language proficiency score accurate? I can test this with various Vanderbilt students that speak Spanish at different levels
**Metric #2**
User ratings from 1-5
Measurement Method: After each session, users provide feedback on how relevant and useful the content was towards achieving their specific learning goals.

## Self-Evaluation
**Due April 26, 11:59pm**

300-1000 words

Address each of the goals, and assess each of the metrics. Include a statement on each on what you achieved or did not achieve, give support for your assessments.

## Reflection on Learning
**Due April 26, 11:59pm**

500-1000 words

What do you take away from the project? Has this changed how you understand AI? Does and how does this affect future plans for learning, work, or otherwise?

## What's Next?
**Due April 22, 11:59pm**

100-500 words

Do you plan on continuing the project? What will you do with what you've learning?
